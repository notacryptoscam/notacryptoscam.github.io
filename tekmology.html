		<h1>Tekmology</h1>
		<h2>NotACryptoScam($NACS) is the first attempt at a blockchain-less cryptocurrency token.</h2>
		<br>
		<h1>Blockchain Alternative</h1>
		<h2>There are many problems with the popular blockchains in crypto as of 2021. The Bitcoin network uses as much energy as Sweden(0.55% of global electricity production). The Ethereum network uses as much energy as a large town(2.62 megawatts). These numbers are unsustainable, and increase Global Warming.</h2>
		<h2>$NACS attempts to fix these issues by not having a blockchain at all. As opposed to Proof of Work(PoW) or Proof of Stake(PoS), $NACS uses a Proof of Ownership system. Instead of mining the blockchain, or running nodes(both of which waste a lot of power), $NACS uses a unified transaction ledger system. This allows us to be one of the greenest tokens of all time.</h2>
		<h2>$NACS runs on a Structured Query Language database, which offers all the advantages of a blockchain, without all of its disadvantages such as high power usage. </h2>
		<h2> All of the clients connect to the central Structured Query Language database and perform operations on it indirectly through our transaction system.</h2>
